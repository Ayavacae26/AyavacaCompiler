Pascal Compiler 

ReadMe

In this project I am going to create a the scanner for our Pascal language as described in the
grammar given in class.  The scanner will be created using the JFlex tool.  This is just the 
begining part for the pascal compiler. This project will be divided in 4 main sections:
1. Scanner 
2. Parser 
3. symboltable 
4. syntax tree
